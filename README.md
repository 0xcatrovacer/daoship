# DAOShip | Solana Bounties & Jobs

## The problem DAOShip solves

DAOShip is a protocol that runs on the Solana blockchain, which provides Job & Bounty opportunities to Solana developers, and
gives interested projects & protocols, access to highly skilled Solana devs.

## Architecture

### DAOs

DAOs are the entrypoint of the protocol. Every project needs to be whitelisted by a DAO, after which projects
can post bounty & job listings for the DAO members / all developers.

### Projects

Projects can post job & bounty listing for Solana developers, with DAOs that have whitelisted them.
**Bounties** have been impletemented as an escrow. Meaning, after a bounty submission has been accepted, funds can be transferred
safely & securely to the concerned developer.

### Developers

Developers building in the Solana ecosystem can get access to jobs & bounties by projects trusted by DAOs.
